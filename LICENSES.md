# Data & Code Licenses

This repository is structured so that different parts are covered by different licenses.

## Code
- All code (scripts, site source) is licensed under the MIT License. See `LICENSE`.

## Data
- OpenStreetMap (OSM) data used in this project is licensed under the Open Database License (ODbL). Attribution required: "© OpenStreetMap contributors". See https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/ for details.
- US Census TIGER/Line shapefiles and other Census data are public domain (no specific license required). See https://www.census.gov for details.

## Redistribution notes
- If a file or product (GeoJSON, shapefiles) includes OSM derived data, the ODbL share-alike requirements also apply to the database distribution. You must attribute OSM and make the data (or a method to obtain it) available under the ODbL if you distribute the raw dataset.
- If your derivative data includes both OSM and non-ODbL data (e.g., TIGER), the ODbL still applies for the OSM-derived content in the database.

## Attribution guidance
- Always attribute OpenStreetMap in your UI or attribution panel with: "© OpenStreetMap contributors".
- For maps showing Census data (e.g., TIGER boundaries), include a line "US Census TIGER/Line: public domain".
