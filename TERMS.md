# Terms & Use (Summary)

This is a non-legal summary to help users understand how data and code can be used.

- The code in this repository (scripts, site code) is licensed under MIT. You can use, modify, and redistribute the code under MIT terms.
- Datasets derived from OpenStreetMap must be redistributed under the ODbL. If you redistribute the dataset, you must provide attribution ("© OpenStreetMap contributors") and make the dataset available under the ODbL.
- US Census TIGER/Line datasets are public domain; they can be freely reused without attribution, although it's good practice to attribute the source.
- If the site provides OSM-derived datasets for download to subscribers, subscribers are free to redistribute under ODbL (share-alike). If you do not want raw data redistributed, consider offering only rendered tiles and not direct database downloads.

If you need a customized license or terms for a commercial deployment or a paywall, seek legal advice for drafting terms-of-service suited to your use case.
